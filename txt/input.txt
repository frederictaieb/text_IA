I don’t know when the sadness started. Maybe it was always there, like a low hum beneath my ribs, a murmur in the background of every sunrise I watched through tired eyes. Maybe I was born with it. Maybe it crept in the night I stopped waiting for my father to come home, and the silence of the front door became a ritual.

The truth is, it doesn’t matter when it began. What matters is that it never really left.

Sadness became the language I spoke to myself in. I wore it like a second skin, heavy and invisible. I carried it into school, into friendships, into every small celebration that should’ve made me feel alive. People said I smiled easily. They didn’t see how much effort it took. They didn’t see the ache behind my eyes.

I remember one morning when the rain hit the window just right, soft and relentless, like the world itself was mourning something. I stood there, holding a cup of coffee that had long gone cold, and I thought, "This is what it feels like to exist without meaning." Not pain. Not despair. Just that quiet erosion. That slow vanishing.

No one noticed. Or maybe they did, and didn’t know what to say. Maybe I’ve always been good at making my suffering palatable. Manageable. A joke here. A shrug there. The sadness simmered under it all.

Then one day, it shifted. Not into healing. Not into hope. But into something sharper.

Anger.

It started with small things. The way someone cut in line. The way a friend forgot to call. The way the world kept spinning while I was frozen. It built like a storm, low and distant at first, then rising, louder, hotter. The kind of heat that consumes air.

I remember yelling at a stranger in traffic, my voice cracking, fists clenched so tight my nails left little half-moons in my palms. It wasn’t about the traffic. It never is. It was about everything.

All the apologies I never got.
All the wounds dressed up as lessons.
All the times I bit my tongue because being angry meant being difficult, and being difficult meant being alone.

I was tired of swallowing it. Of shrinking to fit the spaces people allowed me.

I wanted to burn.

And I did. I scorched bridges I once tiptoed across. I let the fire touch everything I had once protected, once pleaded for. It wasn’t pretty. It wasn’t wise. But it was real.

People started looking at me differently. Some recoiled. Others stared with curiosity. Few understood. That was fine. I wasn’t doing this for them.

I was doing it for the part of me that had never been given permission to scream.

But rage is exhausting. It lights you up, sure, but it also leaves ash in your mouth. There were mornings I couldn’t move. Nights I couldn’t sleep. My skin buzzed with all the things I wanted to destroy.

And then...

I met quiet again.

Not the heavy quiet of sadness.
Not the tense quiet of anger held back.

But a different quiet.

It came in the form of a small moment. I was sitting in a park, watching a little girl chase soap bubbles, her laugh brighter than anything I had felt in months. I don’t know why, but something in me cracked. And not the kind of crack that leads to collapse — the kind that lets light in.

I didn’t cry. I didn’t scream. I just... breathed. For the first time in what felt like years.

And in that breath, I found something I hadn’t dared to look for:
Peace.

It didn’t come all at once. Healing is never linear. But I started seeing colors again. I started hearing songs without them hurting. I started reaching out, not for help, but to help.

I forgave people. Not for them. For me. Because dragging that weight behind me was killing whatever was left of the good.

I forgave myself.

That was the hardest part.

I had to look at the mess I had made — the fires, the silences, the damage — and say, "It’s okay. You were surviving the only way you knew how."

And once I said that, once I truly believed it, joy didn’t feel like a betrayal anymore.

It felt like coming home.

I smiled without forcing it.

I laughed. Loudly. Clumsily.

I danced in my kitchen at midnight.

I let myself be loved again.

It wasn’t perfect. Nothing ever is. But it was real. And that made all the difference.

Today, I walked by a mirror and didn’t flinch.

Today, I saw someone struggling and didn’t look away.

Today, I thanked the version of me who held on through the darkness — the one who cried, and screamed, and almost gave up, but didn’t.

Today, I chose to live.

And tomorrow, I will choose again.

Because now I know: even in the deepest pit, there is a ladder.
Even in silence, there’s a heartbeat.
Even in ruin, something green can grow.

And that’s enough.
